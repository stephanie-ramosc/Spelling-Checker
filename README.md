# Spelling-Checker
An implement and use such a dictionary.

For the first part of the assignment, write a class that implements a Set ADT using a Hash Table.

The second part of the assignment is to write a main program that uses the hash table class. The main program will behave like a spelling checker, that is, when run it will check a document to determine which words are misspelled and provide a list of near-misses for each misspelled word. A near-miss of a misspelled word is a correctly spelled word that is formed by simple modifications to the misspelled word. For example, "chulta" is not a spanish word, but by inserting an "e" we form "chuleta", by deleting the "t" we form "chula", by deleting the "h" we form "culta". Thus, "chuleta", "chula", "culta" are some of the near-misses of "chulta".
